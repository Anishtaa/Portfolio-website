## **1. Introduction**

My portfolio will be a **modern, minimalistic, and dynamic web application** that showcases my personal brand, skills, and projects. I want it to emphasize simplicity, smooth animations, and a professional black-purple theme. My portfolio will be **responsive** on desktop, tablet, and mobile, and will allow me to **easily update my projects** or content in the future.

**Goals:**

* Make a strong first impression with my landing page (my name and picture).
* Showcase my projects in a dynamic, filterable gallery.
* Include an “About Me” section highlighting my skills and experience.
* Optional: Include a Blog/Articles section for my insights.
* Maintain smooth transitions, subtle animations, and a consistent dark theme.

## **2. Full Tech Stack**

**Frontend:**

* **React.js** → I will use it for building dynamic, component-based UI.
* **Tailwind CSS** → For rapid styling with a black/purple theme and responsive design.
* **Framer Motion** → For smooth animations for page transitions and project hover effects.

**Backend (Optional for dynamic content):**

* **Firebase Firestore** → I will store my project data (title, description, image, links) to update projects easily without redeploying.
* **Firebase Hosting** → To host my portfolio online securely.

**Version Control & Deployment:**

* **Git + GitHub** → To track my changes and version control my portfolio.
* **Vercel** → To deploy my React app with continuous integration from GitHub.

**Other Tools:**

* **ESLint + Prettier** → For clean code formatting and linting.
* **React Router** → To handle smooth multi-page navigation.
* Optional: I can manage content via JSON files if I want a simple project update method instead of Firebase.

## **3. Pages & Content**

### **Page 1: Landing Page / Home**

* **Content:**

  * My **name** displayed prominently.
  * **Professional picture** of myself.
  * Subtle tagline describing me (e.g., “Data-Driven Developer | Problem Solver | Detail-Oriented”).
  * Call-to-action buttons: “View Projects” / “About Me”.
* **Features:**

  * Full-screen background with black-purple gradient.
  * Fade-in animations for my name and photo.
  * Smooth scroll to other sections.

* **Features:**

  * Subtle animation on scroll (fade/slide).
  * Black-purple themed skill cards.

---

### **Page 3: Projects**

* **Content:**

  * Each project will have: Title, Description, Tech Stack, Link (GitHub/Live), Screenshot.
* **Features:**

  * **Dynamic grid**: I can fetch projects from Firebase or a JSON file.
  * Filter projects by tech or category (React, Python, Power BI, etc.).
  * Hover animations with project details overlay.

  * Smooth transitions between posts.

---

## **4. Dynamic Content & Version Control**

**Dynamic Projects Setup:**

* **Firebase Approach:**

  * I will store my projects in a Firestore collection with fields: `title`, `description`, `techStack`, `imageUrl`, `liveLink`, `githubLink`.
  * React will fetch the data on page load and render cards automatically.
  * Adding a new project = adding a document to Firebase → I don’t need to redeploy.

* **JSON File Approach:**

  * I can keep a `projects.json` file in `/src/data/`.
  * React reads the JSON and maps it into cards.
  * Adding a new project = update JSON → redeploy.

**Version Control:**

* I will store the entire codebase in a **GitHub repository**.
* **Branching:** `main` for live, `dev` for work-in-progress.
* **Commit Guidelines:** I will update projects, add pages, or styling changes in separate commits.

## **5. Design & Features**

**Theme:**

* Black background: `#000000`.
* Purple accent: `#6e00ff` (buttons, highlights).
* Text color: white/grey for readability.

**Animations & Smooth UI:**

* Fade-in, slide-up, and hover overlays using **Framer Motion**.
* Smooth scroll for single-page sections.
* Subtle hover effects for buttons and project cards.

**Responsiveness:**

* I will use Tailwind breakpoints to ensure mobile, tablet, and desktop compatibility.

**Deployment Workflow:**

1. Develop locally with React & Tailwind.
2. Test responsiveness & animations.
3. Push to GitHub.
4. Deploy to Vercel → automatic build & live URL.
